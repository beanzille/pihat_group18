## Pull/Commit Request Guidelines

2. Any commits should have a clear commit message as to what was done.

## Using the repository

1. Directories and files are clearly labeled indicating what they are.
2. When opening the KiCad schematic and PCB you might need to re-add schematic symbols and footptints. The relavant files will be found in the directory "Schematics/KiCad/Downloaded Components" this should not be an issue as the files parts were set to be relative to the project (When pulling).
