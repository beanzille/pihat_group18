# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

## Pull/Commit Request Guidelines

1. Before doing any Pulls and commits discuss with the other group members as to what you will do.
2. Any commits should have a clear commit message as to what was done.

## Using the repository

1. Directories and files are clearly labeled indicating what they are.
2. When opening the KiCad schematic and PCB you might need to re-add schematic symbols and footptints. The relavant files will be found in the directory "Schematics/KiCad/Downloaded Components" this should not be an issue as the files parts were set to be relative to the project (When pulling).
3. In order to properly download the schematics and pcb one should download the .zip file "Project_Assignment3.zip" found in the root directory. The user then needs to unzip it and open the project on KiCad. If any errors are found then refer to "2." above or contact one of the team members for further assistance in opening correctly (All complications (that by chance arise) are due to the limited access to relavent software needed, but should execute smoothly as tested prior).
